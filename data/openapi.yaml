    This service is an API to query current and past R versions
    and installers. You can use it is devops scripts, e.g. for continuous
    integration tools, to query which version(s) or R you want to install.
    It is updated every hour, so a new R release or a new installer is
    typically picked up within on hour.

    ### Format

    This is a JSON API, all responses are JSON.

    ### The R release process

    In the current R release process, there is a new major or minor release
    every year, typically in April. There are also several patch releases.
    Once there is a newer major or minor release, the older major or minor
    releases typically do not get new patch releases. (E.g. once R 3.6.0 is out,
    the R 3.5.x minor branch will not receive more releases.)

    ### Typical use cases

    * To report the currently released version of R, use `/r-release`.
    * To download and compile the currently released version of R, use
      `/r-release-tarball`.
    * To download the latest Windows or macOS installer, use `/r-release-win`
      or `/r-release-macos`, respectively.
    * To report or download the source or an installer for the latest release
      or the penultimate R minor branch (R-oldrel as CRAN calls it), use
      `/r-oldrel`.

        The last release of the previous minor branch.
        E.g. if the latest released version is '3.6.3', then 'oldrel'
        is the latest patch version of the '3.5' branch, currently '3.5.3'.

  /r-release-tarball:
    get:
      summary: Latest source tarball.
      description: |
        The latest version with a downloadable source code tarball.
        This is usually the same as 'r-release', but it might take
        some time to create a source tarball from the SVN tag. Typically you
        query the release version because you want to download a source tarball or
        an installer. Use this end point if you want to download a source tarball.

  /r-release-win:
    get:
      summary: Latest Windows installer.
      description: |
        The latest version for which a Windows installer is available.
        This is usually the same as 'r-release', but there is typically
        a short delay until the Windows installer is built from the release.
        Use this end point if you want to download the current Windows installer.
